I'm a PhD Research Scholar in [Operations Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research) and [Management Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_science) at [NHH Norwegian School of Economics](https://www.nhh.no/), and am part of the [Centre of Shipping and Logistics](https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/shipping-and-logistics/). My supervisors are [Julio C. Goez](https://www.nhh.no/en/employees/faculty/julio-cesar-goez/) and [Stein W. Wallace](https://www.nhh.no/en/employees/faculty/stein-w.-wallace/).

I specialize in stochastic programming, scenario generation and decision-making under uncertainty.

I collaborate with [Optimeering Aqua AS](https://optimeeringaqua.com/) to develop decision support models for operational risk management in Aquaculture.
